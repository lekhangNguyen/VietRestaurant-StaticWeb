Project: Vietnamese Restaurant
Course: Building Static Website
Group 13: Augustine, Nguyen Le Khang (Team lead); Akter Sanjida; Muskan Umme
Lecturer: Dr. Jawad

Structure of the Web:
Header (include Icon, Navbar, Searchform, Cart)
Body:
  -Home
  -About
  -Menu
  -Product
  -Review
  -Contact
  -Blog
Footer (include media links, back-to-home button, copyright)

Funcions:
  All the static buttons are clickable!
  The Navbar can locate to desire destinations
  Including GIFs (in Home and About)
  Pop-up windowns for all the buttons (in Menu and Blog)
  Contact form requires correct type of information, otherwise, a pop-up windown will apear to notify user

Since this is a Static web, we mainly focus on designing its frontend and HTML stucture.
Further ideas for this web development:
  Create another page for each Blog post for information (include UX, UI)
  Change the cart icon to show wherether the cart is empty or not (Dr. Jawad suggested)
